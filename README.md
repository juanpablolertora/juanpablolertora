I am a Python developer and tech enthusiast focused on building high-performance, private, and local systems. My philosophy is simple: **Understand the tool, own the process.**

### 🐧 The Linux Environment
I chose **Linux Mint** as my primary workstation. For me, Linux isn't just an OS; it's a commitment to transparency and control over my hardware.
- **Terminal-First Workflow:** I manage my development cycle through the shell, from environment configuration to system automation.
- **Local AI Deployment:** I bypass cloud dependencies by running **Ollama** locally. Deploying models like `Qwen2.5-Coder` and `DeepSeek-R1` on my own machine ensures 100% data privacy and zero API costs.

### 🐍 Projects & Technical Focus
I am a builder who learns by doing. I prefer diving into official documentation to understand the architecture behind the code.

- **[Bit-Python-Tutor](https://github.com/juanpablolertora/bit-python-tutor):** My flagship project. A local AI mentor that lives in the terminal. It integrates Python logic with local LLMs to provide a seamless, secure, and immersive learning experience.
- **Core Skills:** Clean Python scripting, Virtual Environments (venv), Git/GitHub version control, and secure configuration management via `.env`.

### 🧠 Learning & Persistence
I apply a "deep-work" approach to everything I learn. As Nelson Mandela said: *"It always seems impossible until it’s done."* My growth is driven by:
1. **Technical Literacy:** Reading documentation to build a solid foundation.
2. **Digital Sovereignty:** Prioritizing open-source tools and local deployments.
3. **Constant Refactoring:** Believing that code is never "finished"—it's only made better.
